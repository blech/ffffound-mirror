This script will download the ffffound archive of a given user.

There's a database of files in db/ffffound_mirror.db (in SQLite 3 format) and 
ffffound's version of the images (which may be at a lower resolution than the 
originals) are downloaded to images/

This uses scraping, since ffffound have no published API. It comes with no 
guarantees.
